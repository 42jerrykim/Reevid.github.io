Dart AOT 분석

# dart platform

[https://dart.dev/overview#platform](https://dart.dev/overview#platform)

두 가지 방법으로 플랫폼을 지원 할 수 있다.

* Native platform: For apps targeting mobile and desktop devices, Dart includes both a Dart VM with just-in-time (JIT) compilation and an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler for producing machine code.
* Web platform: For apps targeting the web, Dart includes both a development time compiler (dartdevc) and a production time compiler (dart2js). Both compilers translate Dart into JavaScript.

# dart compile 하위 명령어

아래의 테이블은 ```dart compile```의 하위 명령어이다.

|Subcommand|Output|More information|
|:---:|:---:|---|
|exe|Self-contained executable|A standalone, architecture-specific executable file containing the source code compiled to machine code and a small [Dart runtime](https://dart.dev/overview#runtime). [더 알아보기](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-compile#exe)|
|aot-snapshot|AOT module|An architecture-specific file containing the source code compiled to machine code, but no Dart runtime. [더 알아보기](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-compile#aot-snapshot)|
|jit-snapshot|JIT module|An architecture-specific file with an intermediate representation of all source code, plus an optimized representation of the source code that executed during a training run of the program. JIT-compiled code can have faster peak performance than AOT code if the training data is good. [더 알아보기](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-compile#jit-snapshot)|
|kernel|Kernel module|A portable, [intermediate representation](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/pkg/kernel/binary.md) of the source code. [더 알아보기](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-compile#kernel)|
|js|JavaScript|A deployable JavaScript file, compiled from the source code. [더 알아보기](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-compile#js)|

# AOT 제약 사항
[https://dart.dev/guides/libraries](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries)에 있는 Core Library중 All 또는 AOT로 시작하는 라이브러리([multi-platform-libraries](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries#multi-platform-libraries), [native-platform-libraries](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries#native-platform-libraries))만 사용 할 수 있다.
