- Let's override the stinking `$max-width` variable in "_variables.scss", which controls the
  maximum width of the entire content on the screen, as it is currently set to `$x-large`, which
  is only 1280px, which is too small to take up the entire width on a standard
  1920 (px wide) x 1080 (px tall) display, and WAY TOO SMALL for a 3840 x 2160 4k display!
This is what is currently in "_variables.scss" under the "Breakpoints" section:

        $small: 600px !default;
        $medium: 768px !default;
        $medium-wide: 900px !default;
        $large: 1024px !default;
        $x-large: 1280px !default;
        $max-width: $x-large !default;

Override $max-width (don't forget the semicolon!):

GS: override any CSS with new CSS styles AFTER the `@import "minimal-mistakes";` line just above!

Anything you place after this point will therefore "cascade and override" the previous CSS styles.

GS: Decrease font sizes of the entire website.
Defaults for small, medium, large, and x-large screens are:
16, 18, 20, and 22px, in that order. All other font sizes are "em"
[typography unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)) multipliers of these pixel
(px) values, and are therefore relative to and changed by these singular pixel values.
See: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1219#issuecomment-326809412
- It looks like the screen pixel sizes to move into each new "size" category are defined in
  the "Breakpoints" section of "_variables.scss"?
